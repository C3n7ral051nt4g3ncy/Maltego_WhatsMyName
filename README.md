# Maltego WhatsMyName Transforms

The Maltego WhatsMyName Transforms are based on the amazing [whatsmyname.app](https://whatsmyname.app/) tool 
created by [Micah "WebBreacher" Hoffman](https://webbreacher.com/) that allows you to enumerate usernames across many websites.

## The Transforms

There are currently 5 Transforms available

- **To Alias [WhatsMyName]**: Extract the username portion (Anything before the @) of en Email Entity.
- **To Sites [WhatsMyName]**: This is the main Transform, it takes an Alias Entity and checks a list of 500+ websites 
for matches on the username. A new OnlineGroup Entity is created for each match.
- **To Category [WhatsMyName]**: Get the category of the OnlineGroup Entities i.e., Social Media, Games, Finance, etc.
- **To Profile URL [WhatsMyName]**: Extract the URL associated with the identified profiles, this Transforms provides 
additional information that can be used to confirm whether the account belongs to the POI.
- **To Platform [WhatsMyName]**: You can use this to extract the Website associated with each platform, this can be used 
to obtain additional information through the Maltego Standard Transforms.

## Installation

Install the required libraries by running

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

A Maltego configuration file **WhatsMyName.mtz** can be automatically generated to easily import the Transforms and 
Transform Set into your client.

1. Open your Terminal and go to your project's main directory.
2. Run `python3 project.py list`

That's all you need, you should now have the new configuration file inside your project.

Your new configuration file includes a Transform set called "WhatsMyName" which will arrange your new Transforms into a 
submenu, making them easier to find and use.

If you are a more advanced user and want to manually add the Transforms to your client, you can follow this
